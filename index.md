## **About Me**

- I'm a third year PhD student in Computer Science at the [Information School](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/) at Renmin University of China.
- I'm advised by Prof. [Xirong Li](http://lixirong.net/) .
- My research interests are Video Retrieval, Code Search and Cross-Modal Adversarial Attack.
- I received a BE degree in Applied Chemistry at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.

## **Research Experience**

### - AI & Media Computing Lab at RUC

PhD student, 2020.09 - Till Now

- Video-text retrieval

  - One paper accepted by *ECCV'22*.

  - 2021 *TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation*  (TRECVID) AVS top3.

    2022 TRECVID AVS top2.

    -  Use Multi-head Self-attention to improve the previous year's SEA model, so that the model can perform weighted fusion of multiple video and text features.
    -  Use image data (COCO, GCC11) pre-training + video data (MSRVTT+TGIF+VATEX) training strategy to improve the model effect.
    -  Perform post-fusion of multiple model results.

- Video Captioning

  - One paper accepted by *ACMMM'21*.

  - *ACMMM'21 Grand Challenge: Pretraining for video captioning*, top 3.

    

- Adversarial Attacks on Language based Image Retrieval 
  - Given an image retrieval system based on text query, the task is to upload advertisement images to the image database. For all queries containing a specific keyword, these advertisement images are ranked very high. To achieve the purpose of interfering normal search and placing advertisement.

  - Attack by pasting an adversarial patch on the image, which is a scannable QR code.

### - Data Knowledge Intelligence Group，Microsoft Research Asia

Research Intern, Code Search

- Propose a "divide-fusion" structure to model long codes and improve long code understanding and retrieval performance.
- Propose a "recall-reranking" method, which first uses text matching and two-tower method to recall high-quality codes, and then uses a single-tower model for re-ranking to get the final retrieval result.
